[**Prerequisites**]
Cuda 7.5
cuDNN v5.1
Matconvnet v1.0-beta20
Matlab 2017a


[**Training**] After you finish all Prerequisites, you can train our network step by step.

  1. Perpare dataset: (same instructions in SiamFC:'Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks for Object Tracking' ) Follow these [step-by-step instructions] in ./ILSVRC15-curation/README.md
  2. Setup the paths in ./training/env_paths_training.m and startup.m 
  3. Run the script for training:
	./training/run_experiment_tri.m 
  4. After training, you can select the epoch with the lowest val errdisp according ./training/triplet_gray/net-train.pdf (net-epoch-1.mat in this test code). Then this model can be used for tracking in next step. 

[**Tracking**]

  1. You can directly run './tracking/demo.m' as a demo to test our algrithom with the pre-trained model ('./models/triplet.net.mat'). You can also try your trained model by modifying ./tracking/run_tracker.m and env_paths_tracking.m.

Note: some codes are borrow from "SiamFC". Thanks for all authors of SiamFC.
